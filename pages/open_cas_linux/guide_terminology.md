| tiered storage     | A data storage technique that moves data between two or more kinds of storage, which are differentiated by four primary attributes: price, performance, capacity, and function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| write-around (wa)  | A caching mode in which some write operations are not cached. Writes to blocks that do not exist in cache are written directly to the core device, bypassing the cache. If a write operation is issued to a block that is already in cache (because of a previous read operation), then writes are sent to both the core device the cache device. Write-around cache improves performance of workloads where write operations are done rarely and no further read accesses to that data are performed, so there is no benefit in caching it. |
| write-back (wb)    | A caching mode in which data is written first to the cache and then mirrored to primary storage when IO bandwidth is available. The process of mirroring to primary storage is known as a *lazy write*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| write-through (wt) | A caching mode in which every write to the cache causes a synchronous write to primary storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
