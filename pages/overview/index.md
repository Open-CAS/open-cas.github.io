## What is OCF?
Open CAS Framwework (OCF) is high performance block storage caching
meta-library written in C. It's entirely platform and system independent,
accessing system API through user provided environment wrappers layer.
OCF tightly integrates with the rest of software stack, providing flawless,
high performance, low latency caching utility.

## What's in it for me?
For short - performance. OCF enables easy block cache deployment for any
performance sensitive application that works with huge data sets stored
on persistent memory. It was primarily designed to cache data from HDD
drives on SSDs, but it also can be used for caching data from QLC SSD on
TLC SSD, Optane drives, RAM memory, or any combination of above including
all kinds of multilevel configurations.

## Who already uses OCF?

Open CAS Framework is heart of two established caching products:
- Intel &reg; Cache Acceleration Software for Linux
- Intel &reg; Cache Acceleration Software for QEMU

We are proudly becoming part of [Storage Performance Development Kit](https://spdk.io/).  
Caching functionality will be available in SPDK from next (19.1) release.

## Who contributes to OCF?

Our open source community is still forming and we are very positive about
that. OCF is mostly developed and maintained by Intel. We are the team who
developed OCF (as a part of CAS) for many years. Now we are very extited
about undergoind transition to truely open source project. We are open
for contributions of any kind. If you feel like helping us make OCF better,
take a look at [Contributing](contributing.html) page.

## How do I get it?

We are fully open source. Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-CAS/ocf) page.
