This document is brief guide for Open CAS documentation writers. If
you feel that there is something missing in documentation feel free
to let us know or submit your own piece of documentation. We really
do appreciate that.

## Documentation repository

Open CAS documentation is developed on dedicated
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Open-CAS/open-cas.github.io).
We use **GitHub Pages** for hosting our online documentation, so if
you are not familiar with it,
[this tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) shoud be
a great starting point.

## Contributing

Contributing rules of documentation repository are the same as in case
of OCF repository. The only difference is that for merging documentation
pull request only one LGTM comment is needed.

You can find complete guide in [Contributing](/contributing.html) section.
