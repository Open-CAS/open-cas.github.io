The **data object** is generic representation of storage, that allows
OCF to access different types of storages using common abstract interface.
OCF uses **data object** interface for accessing both **backend storage**
and **cache storage**. Storage represented by **data object** may be any
kind of storage that allows for random block access - it may be HDD or
SSD drive, ramdisk, network storage or any other kind of non-volatile
or volatile memory.
